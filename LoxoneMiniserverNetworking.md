# Loxone Miniserver Networking
 
The Miniserver allows connections from other computers and can talk to other systems. This document will try to document all ways the Miniserver communicates.

Whenever I need to mention the 6-byte serial number of the Miniserver, I will use `504F11223344` as the serial number. You obviously need to use your own serial number.

The firewall in the Miniserver only allows the configured HTTP port (typically 80) and FTP port (typically 21) to pass through. Additionally HTTPS (port 443) and port 7091 are always allowed. All other will be blocked.

DHCP/NTP/NetBIOS/SSDP/mDNS/UPnp are typical ports to detect or be detected by other network devices. There are no special Miniserver related services being offered by them.

The stream ports are possible destinations for the Loxone configuration, like `/dev/udp`.

The Ports starting at 7070 seem to be a reserved range of UDP ports used by the Miniserver. 7700,7707,7777 are for sending to Loxone specific services, they can all be disabled, if necessary.

The Intercom seems to use a range of ports (5000,7077,8110,8112)


## Finding a Miniserver in the local network

There are two ways to search for a Miniserver in a local network:

1. UDP Broadcast
2. Simple Service Discovery Protocol

To find a Miniserver from outside the local network, you either need to use the DNS service from Loxone or use a VPN setup for your local network.

### UDP Broadcast

To search via UDP Broadcast, broadcast a single 0x00 byte to the UDP port 7070. while listening on UDP port 7071 for about 3s.

Miniservers will reply with one package:

    [LoxLIVE: Loxone Miniserver 192.168.178.32:80 504F11223344 10.2.3.26 Prog:2019-04-24 21:08:03 Type:0 HwId:A0000 IPv6:,0c112233:10020217/O]

- `LoxLIVE:` can be used to detect the message
- `Loxone Miniserver` is the name of the Miniserver. You might notice, that it is tricky to detect the length of the string. You need to scan for a valid IPv4 behind it to figure it out.
- `192.168.178.32:80` is the local IPv4 with the HTTP port number.
- `504F11223344` is the serial number of the Miniserver
- `10.2.3.26` is the firmware version of the Miniserver
- `Prog:2019-04-24 21:08:03` is the date of the Loxone Config file.
- `Type:0`
- `HwId:A0000` is the hardware version of the Miniserver as documented in [Loxone Miniserver Hardware](LoxoneMiniserverHardware.md)
- `IPv6:,0c112233:10020217/O` looks like it is supposed to contain the IPv6 of the Miniserver, but because it is not assigned one, it seems to return garbage, which looks like the serial number of a Air Base Extension with its firmware version.

### Simple Service Discovery Protocol

This protocol is used by many different hardware devices, like Sonos. As such the Miniserver uses `NOTIFY` to inform the network via Broadcast.

The Miniserver also responds to a [SSDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol) request. It returns a reply like this:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    CACHE-CONTROL:max-age=3600
    ST:upnp:rootdevice
    USN:uuid:aabbccdd-eeff-0011-2233-445566778899::upnp:rootdevice
    EXT:
    SERVER:Loxone Miniserver Loxone Miniserver UPnP/1.0
    LOCATION:http://192.168.178.32:80/upnp.xml

It contains the name after "Loxone Miniserver" and the SSDP UUID, as well as a location of an XML, which provides you with the `LOCATION`, which responds with the following XML code, that looks like this:

    <root xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-0">

The important entries are:

- `friendlyName` - the user facing name of the Miniserver
- `modelNumber` - is provided just like the serial number and the UUID from the flash memory.
- `modelDescription` - similar to the UDP request. The hex-string after the `*` also contains the name.
- `serialNumber` - serial number of the Miniserver
- `UDN` - UUID for the Miniserver, similar to its serial number, but only used for SSDP.
- `presentationURL` - URL to the webinterface
- `iconList` - the iconList does not work, because the png asserts are not on the Miniserver. Feels like a bug.


## During starting of the Miniserver

1. SSDP NOTIFY to the local network
2. Send log information, if necessary
3. UDP dynamic IP update via dns.loxonecloud.com:80
4. HTTP request for the weather forecast
5. NTP clock requests


## Loxone News Feed (www.loxone.com)
The Loxone Smart Home application, but also the webinterface to show ads for Loxone products. These can't be disabled!

The web application is requesting

    https://www.loxone.com/loxone-feed.php?channel=app&lang=dede?_=123456789

which requests the annoying advertisements shown in the top-right corner of the app. The `_` parameter is just a random number (actually a timer value) to avoid caching of the data, it could be omitted. The returned data is a JSON block, which looks like this:

## Loxone DNS Service (clouddns.loxone.com)

Loxone offers a dynamic DNS service, which allows finding your own servers via the internet, based on the assumption that your home IP address is not static (which it typically is not). This still requires the Firewall to be open for the Miniserver. In general it is probably still better to have a VPN connection to your home, than relying on security of your home automation server. The advantage of this system is: it is easy and reasonably secure (if there are no security issues in the Miniserver and your passwords are good). That said: you are still exposing your server to the internet!


### Publishing the IP address for a Miniserver

To publish the IP, the Miniserver sends a single UDP request to the Loxone DNS Service on port 7700 with the following content:

    504F11223344,80,00000000,AABBCCDDEEFF0011

- `504F11223344` is the 6-byte serial number of the Miniserver. All Miniservers start with `504F`.
- 80 is the port number under which the Miniserver responds to HTTP requests for the Web-Interface
- 00000000 is the version number of the `WebInterfaceAGZ`
- `AABBCCDDEEFF0011` is an 8 byte unique key. This key is constant for the Miniserver and acts as a validation for the serial number. It protects Loxone against bad guys pushing random serial numbers to their DNS server.

But you might be able to spot a problem with security: because the request is not encrypted, any bad guy who manages to collect one request can then send it's own request to Loxone. The next time you try to connect to your server, you then could end up on a compromised server from the bad guy, telling him your admin name and password!

Also it is called every 60s, which feels excessive. It should be called whenever the external IP changes, but not every minute.

### Finding an IP address for a Miniserver

To find the IP address for a Miniserver, you need to know it's serial number and simply send this request: [http://dns.loxonecloud.com/504F11223344]()

This will get resolved to [http://504F11223344.dns.loxonecloud.com]() which forwards directly to your Miniserver.

Alternatively you can get the DNS status by sending this request [http://dns.loxonecloud.com/?getip&snr=504F11223344&json=true](), which returns a proper JSON reply:

    {
      "cmd": "getip",
      "IP": "123.123.123.123",
      "Code": 200,
      "LastUpdated": "2018-02-01 00:11:22",
      "PortOpen": true,
      "DNS-Status": "registered"
    }

Without the json flag, you get an XML reply. Whatever you prefer, but Loxone has been deprecating XML-based APIs, so I would probably go with the JSON one.

    <Answer cmd="getip" LastUpdated="2018-02-01 00:11:22" PortOpen="1" IP="123.123.123.123" Code="200" DNS-Status="registered"/>


## Mailer / Loxone Mailer Service (mail.loxonecloud.com)
The Miniserver can send emails with status updates to any email account.

When using the standard Mailer service, you have to provide an SMTP server with username and password to send emails, it does support TLS security via SMTP (Thanks for Stefan for pointing this out)

The Loxone Mailer Service is a special mail server from Loxone, which does encrypt data between the Miniserver and the mail server. The disadvantage is a potential limit on the number of emails you can send and that you are relying on Loxone as well as trusting them with you data. Interestingly it is not using SMTP, but HTTPS to send the data. It works in two steps:

1. Request an authorization key via `https://mail.loxonecloud.com/getkey/MINISERVER_SERIAL`. The response is a 48 byte hex string, which converts into a 24 byte ASCII string.
2. Send the email via POST `https://mail.loxonecloud.com/sendmail/MINISERVER_SERIAL` with an XML block containing the user, date, sender, sender name (the server name), receiver, subject, mail body and an authorization code. The user field is the encrypted username and password, the authorization code is calculated with a HMAC-SHA1 with the response from the first request as a key and a secret code plus the Miniserver serial number as the data. This allows the Mail server to validate the partner.

Security: trusting somebody on the internet is always a risk, even Loxone. But mail is not considered really secure and we are typically talking about status updates. Their choice of HTTPS is fine, but their authorization mechanism is kind of weird. Yes, it is a handshake between two partners, but the signature of the reply is only based on the serial number. The username/password are empty anyway, but probably validated via decryption â€“Â which is another check, this time with the date and Miniserver serial number. What is absent are all the other fields, which could be considered an attack surface, because via a man-in-the-middle these fields could be simply replaced with new data. Nevertheless not a very probable attack, but possible, especially if you are in the same network.

## Push Notification Service (push.loxonecloud.com)
This service allows sending notifications to typically mobile devices, like smartphones. The content is similar to mail, but more limited.

Apple requires all iOS software to use HTTPS for notifications, which means that this service is HTTPS based.

Sending a notification is done via an HTTPS POST to `https://push.loxonecloud.com:443/v1/push` with the notification being a JSON block in the body. This block contains a UUID, a timestamp, a title, a message, the name of the Miniserver, a list of UUIDs of devices to notify, a type, an optional sound (none, door bell, alarm, smoke alarm), a level (info,error,system error) and a UUID reference to the notification object in the Loxone configuration. It is also signed via HMAC-SHA1. The server will return a response with a valid status (true/false), an HTTP-like error code and a list of push_errors, e.g. if certain devices are no longer registered for push notifications.

To receive notifications you have to to an HTTPS POST to `https://push.loxonecloud.com:443/v1/register` also with a JSON block.

## Weather Service (weather.loxone.com)

Loxone also offers a subscription to weather service. This service seems to be offered via [Meteo Blue](https://www.meteoblue.com), but routed via a Loxone server [weather.loxone.com](), which validates the subscription. When started the weather service some years ago, Loxone used Ubimet as weather service. But this changed some time ago. Loxone does not disclose which service they use nowadays.

Several times a day (hourly, but at random times) the Miniserver sends the following request: [https://weather.loxone.com:6066/forecast/?user=loxone_504F11223344&coord=13.8408,48.6051&asl=20&format=1]()

You notice a couple of parameters:

- user=loxone_504F11223344 - this is the user account based on the serial number of the Miniserver 
- coord=13.8408,48.6051 - GPS location for the weather report (longitude,latitude). As entered in Loxone Config.
- asl=200 - altitude over sea level in meter. Not sure why this is needed, because `coord` implies it. Can be entered as Elevation in Loxone Config. This parameter seems optional, but the Miniserver always provides it.
- format=1 - the Weather server can return two different report formats: `format=0`, which is XML or `format=1`, which is a mixture between XML and CSV from Meteo Blue. The Miniserver understands both and detects the right format automatically.

I have not found out, when the XML/CSV format is requested, it seems that it can happen after a reboot. Typically the Miniserver seems to request XML. But as I said, the server could ignore the format and simply return whatever is more convenient.

If there is no paid subscription, the response will be this:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 01 Feb 2018 01:02:34 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Content-Length: 153
    Content-Type: text/xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <ServiceExceptionReport><ServiceException>authentication exception: user is not active</ServiceException></ServiceExceptionReport>

From Loxone Config Version 16, Loxone switched over from HTTP to HTTPS for all Miniserver Generation 2. All Miniservers Generation 1 currently still use HTTP. When requesting weather data via HTTPS, the Miniserver verifies the correspnding HTTPS certificate. That is why all existing scripts which simulates the weather service, does not work anymore.

Here is a shortened example for the XML/CSV format. I've only shown the first 2 and last 2 entries. Overall it is 181 entries large. As you can see it has a header, describing the individual columns in the CSV block below. It also has a `valid_until` entry, which contains the subscription expiry date. The Miniserver will start warning, once you hit that date. `Kollerschlag` is a bug, it seems to not know the city, so it falls back to `Kollerschlag`. Longitude and latitude are correct, as well as the elevation. Sunrise/Sunset are also provided, but the Miniserver does it's own calculation locally.

The report has to be hourly and lasts about 7 days into the future. The Miniserver ignores a lot of the data, especially the cloud coverage at different altitudes does not seem to be used.

## Cloud Service Caller (caller.loxone.com)

The Cloud Service Caller is an automated phone callback service from Loxone. It can be configured in Loxone Config. Whenever it is triggered, the Miniserver sends the following request:

[http://caller.loxone.com:80/cgi-bin/loxlive/call.pl?extip=http://dns.loxonecloud.com/504F11223344/dev/sps/io/caller/11389406-009a-2bdf-ffff1402153adf25/&loxid=504F11223344&tel=004912345678&text=Schalter%20aus]()

You can see the following parameters in the request:

- `extip`=[http://dns.loxonecloud.com/504F11223344/dev/sps/io/caller/11223344-5566-7788-99aabbccddeeff00]() - `11223344-5566-7788-99aabbccddeeff00` is the object ID for the Caller Service in the Loxone Config file.
- `loxid`=`504F11223344` - serial number of the Miniserver, the Miniserver needs to have a paid subscription of the  Cloud Service Caller.
- `tel`=`004912345678` - phone number, which need to be called
- `text`=`Schalter%20aus` - the text which will be said to you via text-to-speech

This request triggers a http reply, which content can be ignored.

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n

    2018-02-20 01:11:22:11.22.33.44:CALL TO 4912345678.<br>\n\r\n

Within a few seconds you will get a phone call with the announcement. You can then enter a code, which will be forwarded to your Miniserver (assuming the dynamic DNS is working), it does so by using the `extip` URL and appending the code, like so for the code `1`: [http://dns.loxonecloud.com/504F11223344/dev/sps/io/caller/11223344-5566-7788-99aabbccddeeff00/1]()

The Miniserver will reply accordingly, if the change was accepted:

    GET /dev/sps/io/caller/11223344-5566-7788-99aabbccddeeff00/1 HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: 11.22.33.44\r\n
    Accept: */*\r\n
    \r\n
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \r\n
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\r\n
    Content-Type: text/xml\r\n
    Content-Length: 131\r\n
    Keep-Alive: timeout=10, max=1000\r\n
    Connection: Keep-Alive\r\n
    \r\n
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <LL control="dev/sps/io/11223344-5566-7788-99aabbccddeeff11/pulse" value="1" Code="200"/>\r\n

As you can see, the whole communication is not encrypted. Attacks are possible, but limited:

- you need to know the Miniserver serial number, which has to have a paid subscription
- the request to trigger a callback has to come from the IP address of the Miniserver

As you can see: this would be easily possible for anybody within your home network. From this network you can fake callbacks with no problem. This could be especially tricky if the callback allows security relevant things, like unlocking doors.

Could somebody from the outside hack this? Potentially, but only in a small window:

- you need to catch the Caller request
- within 2 minutes, you can trigger the callback URL, even with different parameters

Is this all a big risk? Probably not, but Loxone could have done better â€“ even without SSL.


## Loxone Update Server (update.loxone.com)

Used if checking for "Automatic Updates" is enabled in Loxone Config. [update.loxone.com]() is a server to serve all updates for the Loxone products, it also hosts the XML file, which is requested by the Miniserver and all other Loxone apps. An update for the Miniserver is installed via an update of the the Loxone Config application. The Miniserver will then update all extensions and devices to the latest version automatically.

    http://update.loxone.com/updatecheck.xml?serial=504F11223344&version=10020326&reason=App

You can see the following parameters in the request, they are all just for logging purposes.

- `serial=504F11223344` - serial number of the Miniserver
- `version=10020326` - current firmware version of the Miniserver
- `reason=App` - why was the updated requested. (`0` = the Miniserver, `App` = a Loxone app requests it)

The reply is a rather large XML file, which starting with Version 10 includes public key certificates and signatures used to validate the software update by the Miniserver. Previous versions just used a checksum. I've replaced the certificate and the signatures with `<CERTIFICATE>` and `<SIGNATURE>` to keep the document brief. As you can see, that there are 3 types of updates:

- Release
- Beta
- Test

Loxone seems to use this to allow public beta tests of their software. Updates are also included for all related products, like the "Loxone Smart Home" app for various platforms and TimeZone updates.

## Loxone Monitor (monitorserver.loxone.com)

The Monitor Server can be enabled in Loxone Config via the "Monitor Server" option. The purpose is to forward the logging, which can be seen in the Loxone Monitor application remotely to help diagnosing issues. The Monitor Server can decided what events are shown and at what detail via the response to the first request from the Miniserver:

    http://monitorserver.loxone.com:80/?504F11223344

Typically the responds looks like this (logging disabled)

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 01 May 2018 01:23:45 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
    X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.45-0+deb7u2
    Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate
    Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT
    Content-Length: 107
    Content-Type: application/xml
    X-Pad: avoid browser bug

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <Log Version="10" LogKeep="true" NoIPchange="false">
      <LogMode>Off</LogMode>
    </Log>

But the server could return something like this:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 01 May 2018 01:23:45 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
    X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.45-0+deb7u2
    Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate
    Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT
    Content-Length: 107
    Content-Type: application/xml
    X-Pad: avoid browser bug

    <Log Version="10" LogKeep="true" NoIPchange="false">
      <LogMode>on</LogMode>
      <LogDest>/dev/udp/192.168.178.200/7777</LogDest>
      <LogLevelCommon>moreinfo</LogLevelCommon>
      <LogLevelSPS>moreinfo</LogLevelSPS>
      <LogLevelProtocol>off</LogLevelProtocol>
      <LogLevelBus>off</LogLevelBus>
      <LogLevelFilesystem>off</LogLevelFilesystem>
      <LogLevelNet>off</LogLevelNet>
    </Log>

This will forward all output to the the UDP port 7777 at the local IP address 192.168.178.200. It will send all possible common and SPS output, but none for Loxone Link (Bus), the filesystem or network access. These are the possible types of data, which can be monitored:

| Type     | Description |
| :------: | ----------- |
| Common   | Displays general information about the Miniserver |
| SPS      | Information about the PLC |
| Protocol | Information on specific protocols such as NTP (time) or UDP |
| Bus      | Information about the CAN bus link |
| File     | Information about the SD card and memory system |
| Network  | Network information for troubleshooting network |

Here are the possible keys:

- `Version` = major version of the Miniserver
- `LogKeep` = boolean, unknown function.
- `NoIPchange` = boolean, if true, the output is send to `/dev/udp/IPADDRESS/PORT` with IPADDRESS being the address of `monitorserver.loxone.com` the the default port being 7777.
- `LogDest` = path for the log file, default is `/dev/null` (logging off)
- `LogMode` = `on` or `off`
- `LogLevelCommon` = `off`,`severe`,`serious`,`warning`,`info`,`moreinfo`
- `LogLevelSPS` = `off`,`severe`,`serious`,`warning`,`info`,`moreinfo`
- `LogLevelProtocol` = `off`,`severe`,`serious`,`warning`,`info`,`moreinfo`
- `LogLevelBus` = `off`,`severe`,`serious`,`warning`,`info`,`moreinfo`
- `LogLevelFilesystem` = `off`,`severe`,`serious`,`warning`,`info`,`moreinfo`
- `LogLevelNet` = `off`,`severe`,`serious`,`warning`,`info`,`moreinfo`
- `LogStart` = Loxone timestamp as an integer
- `LogDay` = integer, number of days logging should be active. Up to 7 days is possible.
- `LogUntil` = UTC date/time string, can be used as an alternative to `LogDay` and supports a longer duration.


## Loxone Log Server (log.loxone.com)

Loxone allows sending Crashlogs automatically to them via the "Loxone Log" setting in Loxone Config. If enabled, the Miniserver will send a binary block of Loxone Support Crashlog, when necessary.

The data is 982 bytes long and send to log.loxone.com:7707 via UDP.

Now the question: what data is in it? Typical crashlog related data:

- timestamp
- serial number of the Miniserver
- version of the Miniserver
- which hardware the Miniserver is running on
- local IP address
- used/maximum memory
- Latitude/Longitude of the Miniserver from the config file.
- name of the owner of the Miniserver from the config file.
- error statistics
- function callstack on a crash

As you can see with the exception of the owner and the Latitude/Longitude of the Miniserver, there is not really any personal data in this block. And the coordinates are send to Loxone via the Weather report anyway.


## Miniserver Web-Interface

The Miniserver offers a HTTP interface at the HTTP port 80 (this port can be changed in Loxone Config). You can use a webbrowser to use the "Loxone Smart Home" directly on the server.

## Miniserver FTP-Interface

The Miniserver offers a FTP interface at the FTP port 21 (this port can be changed in Loxone Config). This is used to upload a configuration or download backups.

The FTP server supports these commands:

| FTP command | Description |
| ----------: | :---------- |
| QUIT        | Logout |
| USER        | User Name |
| PASS        | Password |
| NOOP        | No-Op |
| PASV        | Passive Mode |
| PORT        | Data Port |
| PWD, XPWD   | Print Directory |
| SYST        | System |
| TYPE        | Representation Type |
| OPTS        | Options |
| SITE        | Site Parameters |
| CWD         | Change Working Directory |
| CDUP        | Change to Parent Directory |
| REIN        | Reinitialize |
| FEAT        | Feature Negotiation |
| SIZE        | File Size |
| MDTM        | File Modification Time |
| DELE        | Delete File |
| LIST, NLST  | List, Name List	 |
| MKD, XMKD   | Make Directory |
| RETR        | Retrieve |
| RNFR        | Rename From |
| RNTO        | Rename From	 |
| RMD, XRMD   | Remove Directory |
| STOR        | Store |
